## Project description

A (micro-)service Web system able to "intelligently" recommend – by exposing a SPARQL endpoint – vinyl music records
according to various criteria: user preferences (specified via controlled natural language constructs such as "I always
like/love/prefer classical music, especially opera music by Rossini or Verdi and performed by Angela Gheorghiu or Juan
Diego Flórez; I sometimes like progressive rock and post-rock; I like only metal albums released before 2000; I always
dislike/hate rap and hip-hop; I dislike songs produced by Flood in the last 25 years"), past song purchases on various
music stores, playlists – available online via music streaming services: Last.fm and alternative solutions – and/or
locally – for instance, by uploading a JSPF/XSPF document. The playlists could be created by the user or shared by
her/his virtual "friends" (consider at least one social network). The system will use several music-related knowledge
models (e.g., Music Ontology or MusicRecording concept from schema.org) and available public resources: Discogs,
MusicBrainz, Musicmoz Music Styles.
